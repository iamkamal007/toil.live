There are two ways to configure the websockets. We can do this either through Heroku or PHP or Node.js 

Why configure websockets?
Without diving deep into the technical details, websockets help your GigToDo copy have a seemless messaging experience. With older versions 
of the GigToDo script, we noticed that the messaging/chatting system was very slow. This had to do with so many ajax calls. This was not 
a practical approach. Websockets solve this issue. Your copy will function without this item configured, however, you might expeirnce a poor 
messaging system sometimes.

These are the two different ways you can configure websockets. Choose any one of them:

1) Through Horuku & Github (Eassier Method)

2) Through PHP or Node.js (Harder Method)
  As this is a little more complex, we are working on a more comprehensive, step by step video tutorial to perfectly illustrate this step.
